# Twitter-Response-to-2018-US-Government-Shutdown

With the advent of social media as a tool for political participation and civic activism, Twitter can often convey pertinent information about the public mood during a political event. In this project, we perform a sentiment analysis of all public tweets as well as political leader tweets during the 2018 U.S. Government Shutdown using Naives Bayes Classifier. Focusing on topics that led to the shutdown, we compare the general public and political leadersâ€™ sentiment on Twitter before, during and after the event to gauge differences in their reactions to it. Our results show that while sentiment was not strongly positive or negative during the event, it did impact sentiment negatively later. We achieved an accuracy of close to 70%.
