# Twitter-Response-to-2018-US-Government-Shutdown
With the advent of social
media as a tool for political participation
and civic activism, Twitter can often
convey pertinent information about the
public mood during a political event. In
this paper, we perform a sentiment
analysis of all public tweets as well as
political leader tweets during the 2018
U.S. Government Shutdown. Focusing on
topics that led to the shutdown, we
compare the general public and political
leadersâ€™ sentiment on Twitter before,
during and after the event to gauge
differences in their reactions to it. Our
results show that while sentiment was not
strongly positive or negative during the
event, it did impact sentiment negatively
later.
